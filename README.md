# DRL-Robot-Navigation-ROS2


Deep Reinforcement Learning for mobile robot navigation in ROS2 Gazebo simulator. Using DRL neural network (TD3, SAC), a robot learns to navigate to a random goal point in a simulated environment while avoiding obstacles. Obstacles are detected by laser readings and a goal is given to the robot in polar coordinates. Trained in ROS Gazebo simulator with PyTorch.  Tested with ROS2 Foxy on Ubuntu 20.04 with python 3.8.10 and pytorch 1.10.0+cu113.
